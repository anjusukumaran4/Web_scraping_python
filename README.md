# Web Scraping using #Python -  #Beautiful Soup 

Web scraping is the process extract content and data from a website. Unlike screen scraping, which only copies pixels displayed onscreen, web scraping extracts underlying HTML code and, with it, data stored in a database.

When we run the code for web scraping, a request is sent to the URL that we have mentioned. As a response to the request, the server sends the data and allows you to read the HTML or XML page. The code then, parses the HTML or XML page, finds the data and extracts it.
