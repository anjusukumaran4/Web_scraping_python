# Web Scraping using Python

Web scraping is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website. Unlike screen scraping, which only copies pixels displayed onscreen, web scraping extracts underlying HTML code and, with it, data stored in a database. The scraper can then replicate entire website content elsewhere. We can use python for web scraping.

Technology: Python (pandas, numpy, BeautifulSoup)
